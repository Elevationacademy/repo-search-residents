# Coding Challenge for EA Teaching Residents

## Introduction

This challenge will help us evaluate your proficiency and experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is NOT a "pass/fail" exam, so please do your best, even if there are elements you are not comfortable with. Budget around 2 hours to complete this.

First, notice there are a few blank files for you to start with.

* [index.html](index.html)
* [style.css](style.css)
* [script.js](main.js)

You should not need any additional files. Also, notice that we've included CSS Bootstrap to make styling easy. We have not included jQuery or any other libraries, but you are permitted to include any other libraries you want to complete the task.

## Requirements

You will be building a small app that will search different organizations on github and find the repos that are associated with those organizations. Along with the different public repos associated with each organization, we will also display how many times each repo has been "forked" (copied). This will enable us to gage how "popular" a project is. For example, below is Facebook. As you can see, their most popular open-source project is "React".
