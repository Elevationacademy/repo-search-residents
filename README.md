# Coding Challenge for EA Teaching Residents

## Introduction

This challenge will help us evaluate your proficiency and experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is NOT a "pass/fail" exam, so please do your best, even if there are elements you are not comfortable with. Budget around 2 hours to complete this.

First, notice there are a few blank files for you to start with.

* [index.html](index.html)
* [style.css](style.css)
* [main.js](main.js)

You should not need any additional files. Also, notice that we've included CSS Bootstrap to make styling easy. We have not included jQuery or any other libraries, but you are permitted to include any other libraries you want to complete the task.

## Requirements

You will be building a small app that will search different organizations on github and find the repos that are associated with those organizations. Along with the different public repos associated with each organization, we will also display how many times each repo has been "forked" (copied). This will enable us to gage how "popular" a project is. For example, below is Facebook. As you can see, their most popular open-source project is "React".

A use will type in an "organization" and click search, then the data will show up below. When a user searches for a different organization, the previous data will be removed. For this challenge you will need to:

* Visually adhere to the image above.
* Retrieve the necessary data using the github api.
* Sort the repos by `forks_count`, so as to show the "most popular" repos first.
* Have each repo name link to the `html_url` for that repo. Be sure to open the link in a new tab.

When you're finished, please send your work to your Elevation Academy contact as a .zip file or (preferably) a link to a public repo on GitHub.

## Questions?

Please use your best judgment to interpret the requirements above. However, if you're stuck with questions, feel free to email Aaron (aaron@elevationacademy.co).

For questions related to the interview process, email Nelly (office@elevationacademy.co).

There are no bad questions (well, for the most part... there sort of are so just don't ask those).
